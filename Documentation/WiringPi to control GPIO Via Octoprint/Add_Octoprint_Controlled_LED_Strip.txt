***You must install WiringPi to utilize the rest of these instructions
***Install instructions are atL http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
***To install WiringPi SSH into to pi (I use putty from windows)

git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi
cd wiringPi
git pull origin
./build



***You must tell the PI how the GPIO pins we have selected will be used (we need them as outputs outputs)
***Add this to the end of /etc/init.d/octoprint
***Edit it by SSH to pi and type: sudo nano /etc/init.d/octoprint

#Run export GPIO Raspberry

/usr/local/bin/gpio export 17 out
/usr/local/bin/gpio export 18 out
/usr/local/bin/gpio -g write 17 1
/usr/local/bin/gpio -g write 18 1




***We need to add custom actions in Octoprint to turn the relays on and off via GPIO
***Add this to the System->Actions area of config.yaml  
***Edit it by SSH to pi and type: sudo nano ~/.octoprint/config.yaml
***CTRL-V to scroll down until you see the actions
***Type the text below to add the new actions, then CTRL-X to exit and save when exiting

  - action: Relay1On
    command: gpio -g write 17 0
    name: Turn on Relay1
  - action: Relay1Off
    command: gpio -g write 17 1
    name: Turn off Relay1
  - action: Relay2On
    command: gpio -g write 18 0
    name: Turn on Relay2
  - action: Relay2Off
    command: gpio -g write 18 1
    name: Turn off Relay2
