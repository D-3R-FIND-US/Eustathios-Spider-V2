# Eustathios-V2
Update to Eustathios with a little bit of HercuLien design changes

Please know this is currently a WIP, if you build it now please know parts in the assembly may be named incorrectly and assemblies are subject to change. FOr example the extrusion hole locations are still called out in the part names at the old locations for Eustathios Spider V1, so if you order based off part names now the holes will not be in the correct location. Also the lead screw length, belt lengths, etc are still being determined.

Thanks, I think it will be witrth the wait.
