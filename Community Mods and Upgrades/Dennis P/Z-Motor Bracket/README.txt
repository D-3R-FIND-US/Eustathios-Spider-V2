Alternate Z motor mount bracket- I goofed when I ordered belts and ordered one too short.
 
I decided to make use of an additional crossbar and put the tensioner on a revised Z motor mount. 

Z Motor rotated 45 degrees to get the tensioner closer to the spindle to get better belt wrap on the idler and motor pulley.
