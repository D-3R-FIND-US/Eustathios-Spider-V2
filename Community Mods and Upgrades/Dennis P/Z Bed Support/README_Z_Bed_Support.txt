Z bed support modified to receive bronze nut for TR8x8 Metric ACME leadscrew. 

1. Counterbored 0.5mm the back of the support to locate the nut (22mm OD) to aid assembly. 
2. Located the 4 holes for fixing screws. The nuts I received were drilled and tapped for M3x0.5 screws on a 16mm bolt circle, 90 degrees apart.  

Similarly  available hardware appears to be compatible, but double check the hole spacings and bore diameters.
