Z bed support modified to receive bronze nut for TR8x8 Metric ACME leadscrew. Mods doen to both the original Z_Bed and Walter Hsiao's design. 

1. Counterbored 0.5mm the back of the support to locate the nut (22mm OD) to aid assembly. 
2. Located the 4 holes for fixing screws. The nuts I received were drilled and tapped for M3x0.5 screws on a 16mm bolt circle, 90 degrees apart.  
3. Lengthened the bearing holder and added an additional row of holes on WAlter Hsiao's Z_Bed support. 


Similarly  available hardware appears to be compatible, but double check the hole spacings and bore diameters.
