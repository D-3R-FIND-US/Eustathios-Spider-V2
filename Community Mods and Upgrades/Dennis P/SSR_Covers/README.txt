The knockoff uxcell SSR-10DA 10A DC 3-32V to AC 24V-380V SSR Solid State I used did not have terminal protectors on either the high or low voltage terminals. 

These covers were designed for M4 fixing screws to be utilized with hammer nuts in your extrusion or to the provided heatsink.

The 3mm LED hole is for a pre-wired 12V indicator LED to be used on the 12V side, wired in parallel to the heatbed trigger circuit so that you may be able to visually verify that the SSR is being triggered by the controller board.
