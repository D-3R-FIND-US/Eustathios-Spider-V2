Changes to the original design by Walter Hsiao, (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1322641)

1. Added M3 heatserts for the top & bottom E3D hotend clamp screws, added a boss to support the bottom insert.
2. Counterbored the clamp screw holes for M3 set screws. You can fit an regular M3x0.5-40mm cap screw if you can not find M3 setscrews that are long enough.
3. Added pilot holes for Daniel F Fan support parts. 
4. Offset the 40mm fan hole to provide a little more material to secure the heatserts. 
5. Remodeled the top clamp so that the end of the setscrew is captive in the clamp to aid assembly. 

Print Settings: 0.2mm layer heights
Top Layers- I did 5 and got a little bit of deformation around the M3 heatserts. 
Sidewalls- I did initial prints with 0.8mm, but I might go higher to give a little more plastic around the heatserts.
