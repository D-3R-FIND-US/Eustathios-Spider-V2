Makerbot style endstop switch holders for X, Y & Z axis. 

Included are holders for both MAX & MIN locations, though only the MIN's are normally required. 

Reliefs in the parts for the solder buildup and header pins may required some adjustment and opening up for the PCB's to sit flat. YMMV....

The thru fixing holes in brackets are 2.5mm for making threads with an M3 spiral point tap so that the chips eject out the back of the part.
