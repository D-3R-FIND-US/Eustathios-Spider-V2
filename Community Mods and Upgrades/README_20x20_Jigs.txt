Drill and Tapping Jigs for 20x20 extrusions:

End_Tap_Jig to guide a standard M5 tap parallel to the extrusion axis. There are 2 versions- one with a standard M5 nut well, and one with a 5mm bore. 
	The one with the nut is intended to be printed with the flat end down and paused to insert the nut when the print reaches the top of the well. By using a nut in the jig, it will time the tap to the same orientation of the end of the extrusion.  
	
	For extrusions with solid core holes, a spiral point tap will probably be sufficient. For extrusions with interrupted core holes (like the 8020 variety) this jig works best using a spiral fluted tap so that there are always threads engaged in the lobes of the core. The play in the nut well allows for the nut and tap to float a bit to accommodate any errors or tolerances in the print or extrusion. 
	
	The one without he nut is just a simple guide with a straight 5mm bore with more support than the top and bottom edges of the nut well would provide. The sides of the guide will wear as you use it so more support is preferable. I have not tested this variant, but provide it for convenience.  
	
Leg Drill Jigs are to locate and guide a drill at the proper position and square to the extrusion. The use of spotting drills or center drills are recommended but not required- ordinary twist drill will work but have the potential to enlarge or distort the hole and bore alignment with uneven drill pressure (yer gonna waller that hole up!).
 
	Center drills are available in both Metric and Imperial sizes-- this jig is sized for a standard Number 1 drill that has a body diameter of 1/8" or 3.18mm.  Center drills have a short flute and solid body so the sides of the drill will not wear the guide bore of the jig. 
	
	Use an M5 screw to secure the jig to the extrusion and set the end distance consistently. While you can thru-drill the hole from one side, it is recommended tha the jig be repositioned to drill the opposite side of the extrusion. Once the hole center is spotted, use an 3.5mm (or 9/64", or #6 screw shank hole sized bit)drill to create the access hole for the 3mm Allen key for the M5 button head cap screws.
	
	Top holes set the first hole 7mm from the end of the extrusion and the second hole is spaced 85mm from the center of that hole. 

	Bottom hole jig has only 1 hole and is set to be 80mm from the end of the extrusion.
